### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm Enzo Kusuki, a brazilian self-taught programmer and software developer.

***

I very much like to learn about anything related to technology, especially software development. Currently, I am focused on learning full-stack web development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), in which I am very close to finishing their Full Stack Javascript course. It should be finished by 2024.

Even though that is my main focus currently, I also love to learn about other topics and technologies, and am currently focused on landing my first job. If you want to collaborate, have an opportunity for me, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out through my contacts!

Also, even though I am brazilian, this profile and my projects are all in english currently, and that is mostly because I learned programming entirely through english sources. However, I might update this profile to include both english and portuguese descriptions and information in the future.

I am also an avid Rock/Metal fan, and play both guitar and bass. ðŸ¤˜
