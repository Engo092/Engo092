### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm Enzo Kusuki, a brazilian self-taught programmer and software developer.

I very much like to learn about anything tech-related, especially software development. In this page you will find my full-stack projects made while following the online curriculum [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

I am currently employed by a brazilian financial institution, if you feel any interest in my work, have an opportunity for me, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out through my contacts!
