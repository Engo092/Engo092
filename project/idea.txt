maybe a "time measurer" to help in managing time?

Ex: You press to start timer and which activity you are doing right now, and press stop, during which there will be a log that includes info like: which activity, start time, end time, time spent, etc.
You could also reset the log activity, remove unnecessary ones...
"maybe" features: ability for user to divide logs in dates, somehow let the timer run even when system is off.
